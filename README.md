# robotap

an unofficial implementation of robotap

We use the robosuite environment due to my limit desktop gpu. If you find some environments that don't need lots of computing resources, don't hesitate to tell me.

## Installation

First, you should prepare for the robosuite environment:
```
conda create -n tapnet python=3.10
pip install mujoco
pip install robosuite
```
Then, prepare for tapnet methods according to [the official repository](https://github.com/google-deepmind/tapnet).
